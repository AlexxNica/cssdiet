=======

A DevTools extension for multi-page unused CSS auditing. Inspired by UnusedCSS and Helium.

## Goals

* Empower developers to find unused CSS contributing to page-load time
* Offer a better solution to current DevTools Audits panel unused CSS report (based on a single page rather than multi-page)
* Has to perform more optimally than current bookmarklet solutions

## Workflow

* Navigate through pages of interest on a site
* Perform auditing on what CSS selectors remain unused
* Provide a per-stylesheet breakdown of these selectors
